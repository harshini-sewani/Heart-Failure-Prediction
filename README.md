# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Heart Disease is one of the major concerns for society today. It is difficult to manually
determine the odds of getting heart disease based on risk factors. However, machine
learning techniques are useful to predict the output from existing data. Identifying the
processing of raw healthcare data of heart information will help in the long term saving of
human lives and early detection of heart failure.ML techniques were used in this work to
process raw data and provide a new and novel method to detect heart failure.

The mortality rate can be drastically controlled if the disease is detected at the early
stages and preventative measures are adopted. Random Forest and MLP were able to
perform very well with 85% accuracy, 78.94% sensitivity and 87.8% specificity. AdaBoost
sensitivity was very low and could be vulnerable for prediction of heart failure. Correlation
matrix did not help us much compared to p-test. All the p-test attributes are enough for
detection of heart failure “age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and time”. Also, we see
significant improvement using Repeat K-fold CV in KNN.
